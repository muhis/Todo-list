<h1>Faraday's UI developer Test (12.07.2016)</h1>

<div id="dataContent">

</div>

<h3>Task: Improve the source code of this file based on these instructions</h3>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li>TODO 1: Based on model, build html content showing project names, add append it to 'id=dataContent' element</li>
	<li>TODO 2: Implement deleting project in a way so that integrating this UI to backend may happen seamlessly.</li>
	<li>TODO 3: When clicking a project's name, that project's tasks should be shown on right. Another click should hide them. </li>
	<li>TODO 4: Add (at least) one animation that improves UX a bit at least</li>
	<li>TODO 5: make Project.clone -function to clone tasks also</li>
	<li>TODO 6: Give a short description of what you did related to each previous TODO (, or why you did nothing), and why you did it like you said.
<hr>
	</li>
		<li>TODO 7: Make other 3 small UX polishment fixes, argue why they were the most important ones</li>
		<li>TODO 8: Make 3 small refactorings (if possible), argue why they were the most important ones (,or why it wasn't possible to make small refactorings)
				<hr>
		</li>

		<li>TODO 9: Suggest how you would integrate this UI to backend. How would you do it yourself or what kind of developer you think should do it?</li>
		<li>TODO 10: If you were weak and did extra (or too big) refactorings, what were they and why did you do them? Or which refactorings or features did you nearly do? </li>
		<li>TODO 11: How would you improve this test! :-)</li>
		<li>TODO 12: Send your code to <span id="mSpan">markus</span>@<span style="display: none;">dsadadasd</span>faraday.fi (=me)!! Thanks, or publish it twitter and tag me (@tsankari)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other instructions: Apply these priorities:</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>     Getting the job done</li>
	<li>     Not making unnecessary big changes<br>
	     Being able to tolerate a bit of ugliness(but not too much) is a virtue :-) !!</li>
</ol>
